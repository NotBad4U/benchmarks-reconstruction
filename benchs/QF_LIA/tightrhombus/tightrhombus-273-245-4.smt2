Benchmarks used to test cut selection engine in SMTInterpol.
Seem to be of interest because they're easy but many tools can't
solve them.

The name contains a size of the numbers (third number in the file name).
With increasing number, the numbers in the benchmark increase and a bigger
cut has to be selected to refute the formula.

Submitted for SMT-LIB by Juergen Christ.

A tight rhombus without a feasible integer solution.
This benchmark is designed to be hard for the algorithm by Dillig, Dillig,
 and Aiken.

Authors: The SMTInterpol team.
